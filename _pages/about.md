Hi! I am a master student in biostatistics at University of Washington. I have a passion for gene expression analysis and immunotherapy. Currently, I am working on Identify -Omic Biomarkers for Cancer Immunotherapy and Early Detection at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) supervised by [Dr. Wei Sun](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/sun-wei.html). 

During undergrad, I worked on a research project of Genetic Analysis for Parkinson's Disease with [Dr. Daisy Philtron](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dlp245) and [Dr. Ben Shaby](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bshaby/). I created a R shiny web app for students to understand population growth concepts with [Dr. Dennis Pearl](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dkp13).

I graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in Computational Statistics. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, listening to the music, doing yoga, visiting art museums and baking.


This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
