Hi! I am a master student in biostatistics at University of Washington. I have a passion for gene expression analysis and immunotherapy. Currently, I am working on Identify -Omic Biomarkers for Cancer Immunotherapy and Early Detection at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center supervised by Dr. Wei Sun. 

During undergrad, I worked on a research project of Genetic Analysis for Parkinson's Disease with Dr. Daisy Philtron and Dr. Ben Shaby. I created a R shiny web app for students to understand population growth concepts.

I graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in Computational Statistics. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, listening to the music, doing yoga, and baking.
