Hi! I am a second year master student in biostatistics at University of Washington.  I love extracting valuable insights from large data to improve people's life and I am dedicated to working in the healthcare industry. I have a passion for gene expression analysis and immunotherapy as well. 

I completed my capstone project on building models to predict inpatient admission with racial bias correction at [Community Health Plan of Washington](https://www.chpw.org/). Additionally, I have worked on Identifying -Omic Biomarkers for Cancer Immunotherapy and Early Detection at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) supervised by [Dr. Wei Sun](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/sun-wei.html). 

During undergrad, I worked on a research project of Genetic Analysis for Parkinson's Disease with [Dr. Daisy Philtron](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dlp245) and [Dr. Ben Shaby](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bshaby/). I created a R shiny web app for students to understand population growth concepts with [Dr. Dennis Pearl](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dkp13).

I graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in Computational Statistics. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, doing yoga, visiting art museums and baking.
