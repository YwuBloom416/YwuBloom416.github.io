Hi! I am a master student in biostatistics at University of Washington. I have a passion for gene expression analysis and immunotherapy. Currently, I am working on Identify -Omic Biomarkers for Cancer Immunotherapy and Early Detection at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) supervised by [Dr. Wei Sun](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/sun-wei.html). 

During undergrad, I worked on a research project of Genetic Analysis for Parkinson's Disease with [Dr. Daisy Philtron](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dlp245) and [Dr. Ben Shaby](https://www.stat.colostate.edu/~bshaby/). I created a R shiny web app for students to understand population growth concepts with [Dr. Dennis Pearl](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/dkp13).

I graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in Computational Statistics. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, listening to the music, doing yoga, visiting art museums and baking.
